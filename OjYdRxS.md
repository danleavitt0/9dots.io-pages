title: "Cardboard Robots: Planning"
blurb: "Using their blueprints as a guide, students will plan the order in which they build their robot, and then begin the process of building it."
objective: 
  - Explain the importance of a building plan
  - Create a building plan based on their blueprints

## Setup

### Materials:

- Cardboard
- MakeDo pieces

### Project Time:

- 40 minutes

## Engage

1. _How to engineers start building?  Do they have a plan?_
	- Once engineers have made blueprints, they need to plan out what order to build their design in.

2. Today, students start planning the order in which they are building their robots.

3. _Do you think itâ€™s a good idea to start by building the fingertip?  Why not?  What part of the robot should you start building?_
	- It is important to start building with the base of a robot so that there is a platform on which to build the other parts.

## Explain
To practice building based on a plan, the group generates a plan using an example blueprint.

1. On the board, show a blueprint of a robot. As a group, plan out the order of building the robot. 
	- It is important to build the body of the robot first, before moving on to the head, and then finally the limbs
    - This order is important because the robot needs to have it's fixed parts before any moving parts can be added.

## Elaborate

1. Before they can start building, students write out the order that they are building the robot. Planning the order in which they build is an important step in the process of engineering!

2. Using their blueprints and building plan as a guide, students  start building their dream robots!
