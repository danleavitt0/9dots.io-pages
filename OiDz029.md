## Setup

### Materials:

- Computer with GarageBand software
- [Secret Agent Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMuQchbJRG0)
 
## Introduce

### DO NOW:
Students will write down their best guess to the question, “How are songs created?”

## Guided Practice

### EXPLAIN:
Modern music is created using computer software and microphones. Each instrument (drums, guitar, vocals, etc) are recorded separately and then mixed together using the software on the computer. In fact, some of the music doesn’t even come from an instrument, but from the computer itself. For this project, we will be using the GarageBand software to create our own songs and movie scores.

###CREATING MUSIC WITHOUT INSTRUMENTS:
In GarageBand, it is not necessary to play instruments at all. The software comes with music that is already created in short segments that can be put together to create a song. The short segments are called “Loops.” By finding the correct loops and mixing them together, you can create a wide variety of music without any instruments.

###WATCH:
Students will watch the [Secret Agent Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMuQchbJRG0) to learn about how to add loops to create a song.

## Explore

###CHECK FOR UNDERSTANDING:
_What is a loop?_

### CREATE:
Students will use the information from the video and a handout with the loops used to create their own secret agent songs. Students will create the same one as in the tutorial first, and then once that is completed, they can try altering it to make it their own.
