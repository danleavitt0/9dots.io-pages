## Setup

### Materials:

- Computer with GarageBand software
- [Secret agent tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMuQchbJRG0)
- [Secret agent song handout](http://uploads.9dots.io/OjM5Drh.pdf)

### Preparations:

- Set up projector with speakers

### Project Time:

- 45 minutes
 
## Engage

Students write down their best guess to the question, “How are songs created?”

## Explain

1. Modern music is created using computer software and microphones. Each instrument (drums, guitar, vocals, etc) are recorded separately and then mixed together using the software on the computer. In fact, some of the music doesn’t even come from an instrument, but from the computer itself. For this project, student are using the GarageBand software to create their own songs and movie scores.

2. In GarageBand, it is not necessary to play instruments at all. The software comes with music that is already created in short segments that can be put together to create a song. The short segments are called **loops**. By finding the correct loops and mixing them together, you can create a wide variety of music without any instruments.

3. Students will watch the [Secret Agent Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMuQchbJRG0) to learn about how to add loops to create a song.

## Elaborate

1. Check for understanding by asking, _"What is a loop?"_

2. Students use the information from the video and a handout with the loops used to create their own secret agent songs. Students create the same one as in the tutorial first, and then once that is completed, they can try altering it to make it their own.
