objective: "SWBAT define Newton's third law of physics, and explain why the flight of a projectile is parabolic/"
blurb: "Students will design #rockets to achieve maximum distance using just construction paper, an index card, and some tape."

## Setup
### Materials:

- Construction Paper
- Index cards
- Scotch tape
- 2 Liter Soda Bottle
- PVC pipe
- Duct tape
- Vinyl tubing

### Preparation:

- Construct launcher (see wiki)

## Engage
Show a [video of pumpkin chunkin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmSyrGsqmg8). Like in the video, students will be creating their own projectiles and launching them by stomping on a soda bottle.

## Explain
**Projectile**:
When you throw a ball, toss a pumpkin, or launch a stomp rocket, the object that is thrown or launched is called a projectile. In this activity, our rocket is a projectile.

**Projectile motion**:
Once launched, all projectiles follow a frown-shaped path known as a parabola, due to the effects of gravity. Gravity, which acts downward, only influences the vertical motion of the projectile. The initial velocity of an object determines its horizontal motion, which remains the same (constant) throughout its flight.

**Velocity**:
The direction and speed of an object together tell us the object’s velocity. 

**Launch angle**:
A 45 degree launch angle gives the rocket the best mix of horizontal and vertical velocity.

**Newton’s 3rd law**: 
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Our rocket’s initial velocity comes from the air pressure that builds up in the pipe when you step on the bottle. When the rocket is fitted onto the end of the pipe, it forms an airtight seal. When you step on the bottle, air is forced out of the bottle into the pipe, which pushes the rocket off the pipe so the air can escape. The “push” that the air gives the rocket determines the initial speed of the rocket. The direction of the pipe determines the initial direction of the rocket.

## Explore
Students will attempt to build their own rockets from the paper.
Building the Rockets: 

1. Wrap paper loosely around the PVC pipe (if you wrap the paper too tightly around the pipe, friction will keep the rocket stuck on the pipe during launch)
2. Tape the seam, then slide the paper off the pipe
3. Flatten the tube at one end, use scissors to cut the flat edge into a sharp point
4. Tightly tape the point so air does not escape

Adding Fins:

1. Fold a 3 x 6 index card in half, open at fold and cut along the fold
2. Cut along the diagonals of the half cards
3. Tape the fins on the rocket, spaced equally apart from each other

## Evaluate
Students will make a second rocket and launch it. Students should be asked what angle they would like their rocket launched at.
