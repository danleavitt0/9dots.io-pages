## Materials

- Construction paper
- [Copper tape](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10561)
- [LED lights](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12062)
- [Conductive paint](http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/electric-paint-10ml/)
- [Energy ball](http://www.amazon.com/Energy-Ball-Scientific-your-fingertips/dp/B000OU9RMS)

## Media and Handouts

- Robot images

## Project Time

- 40 minutes

## Introduce

### Hook:
_What components are needed to turn on a light?_
A light need a power source, wires, and a switch to be able to light up.

_How does it work?_
When all of those components are connected, they make a circuit.

## Guided Practice

### Explain:
_What is a circuit?_
Circuits are like a one way street for electricity. The battery pushes the electricity through the wires, across the switch, to the light, and finally back to the battery. For the cars (or electricity) to flow, all of the roads must be connected.

### Try It:
Using the energy ball, test the concept of a circuit. All of the students will stand in a circle holding hands. Two people standing next to each other will be the light, with each of them holding on to one of the electrodes (the metal pieces). When the whole circle is connected, the ball will light up and make a noise.

### Switches:
A switch makes it possible to turn a light on and off by opening and closing a circuit. To test this concept, designate one student to be the switch. He or she will be in charge of turning the light on and off by opening and closing the circuit (letting go off their neighbors hand).

### Illustrate:
In a team of two, students will now diagram a circuit. They should be sure to include all of the components (power source, wires, switch, and light) and show the direction in which the electricty is flowing.

## Explore

### Materials:
Show students the materials they will be using to create their own circuits. Make sure to relate each of them to the components of a circuit that students have learned about.

o	Learn about circuits
•	How does a light light up? What components do you need?
•	Power source
•	Wires
•	Switch
•	When all of these components are connected, they make something called a circuit
o	Understand the different components of a circuit
•	Use the energy ball to make a human circuit
•	http://www.amazon.com/Energy-Ball-Scientific-your-fingertips/dp/B000OU9RMS
•	Experiment with what happens when people break the circuit
o	Circuits are like a one way street – 
•	Electricity needs to be flowing in the correct direction, and all of the roads need to be connected for cars to flow
•	As a group, work to make the diagram of the one way streets so that the cars can flow
•	Show how this is the same concept for a circuit with battery and light
o	Review pieces of the bare conductive cards – have example there
•	Have a picture on the board of the light and the battery to show the positive and negative sides
o	make robot cards with circuits
•	walk students through the steps to make a circuit with an led light
o	discussion – how could you use the bare conductive on your final robot?
