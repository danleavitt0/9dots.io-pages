## Project Time

## Introduce

## Guided Practice

## Explore


o	Learn about circuits
•	How does a light light up? What components do you need?
•	Power source
•	Wires
•	Switch
•	When all of these components are connected, they make something called a circuit
o	Understand the different components of a circuit
•	Use the energy ball to make a human circuit
•	http://www.amazon.com/Energy-Ball-Scientific-your-fingertips/dp/B000OU9RMS
•	Experiment with what happens when people break the circuit
o	Circuits are like a one way street – 
•	Electricity needs to be flowing in the correct direction, and all of the roads need to be connected for cars to flow
•	As a group, work to make the diagram of the one way streets so that the cars can flow
•	Show how this is the same concept for a circuit with battery and light
o	Review pieces of the bare conductive cards – have example there
•	Have a picture on the board of the light and the battery to show the positive and negative sides
o	make robot cards with circuits
•	walk students through the steps to make a circuit with an led light
o	discussion – how could you use the bare conductive on your final robot?
