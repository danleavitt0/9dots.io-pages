## Setup

### Materials:

- Pipe cleaners
- Construction paper
- Paper cups
- Straws
- Fabric
- Other craft supplies...

### Media and Handouts:

- [Robot budget](http://uploads.9dots.io/OjeKGGN.pdf)

### Project time:

- 40 minutes

## Engage
Engineers can’t build everything in their wildest dreams – they need to work with a budget. From this point on, all materials that students use need to be payed for.

## Explain

1. _What is a budget?_
	- A budget tracks how much money you start with, how much you spend, and how much you have left.

2. On the whiteboard, give an example of a budget. For example, students have $20 to buy sports equiment. The cost of the equiment is:

	- Basketball - $5
	- Soccer ball - $4
	- Football - $3
	- Jump rope - $1

3. What items could that class get and how much would they have left over?

## Elaborate

1. Show students the innovation store (where the materials are kept). Starting now, students have a $10 budget (fake money) to spend on any decorations that they would like. For each item students use, they need to subtract its price from their budget.

2. Review the order that students should be working on tasks:

	1. Finish building circuits on robot
	2. Finish building cardboard pieces of the robot
	3. Decorate the robot using innovation store budget.
