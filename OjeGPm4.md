## Setup

### Materials:

- Pipe cleaners
- Construction paper
- Paper cups
- Straws
- Fabric
- Other craft supplies...

### Media and Handouts:

- Robot budget

### Project time:

- 40 minutes

## Introduce

### Hook:
Engineers can’t build everything in their wildest dreams – they need to work with a budget. From this point on, all materials that students use will need to be payed for.

## Guided Practice

### Explain:
_What is a budget?_
A budget tracks how much money you start with, how much you spend, and how much you have left.

### Show:
On the whiteboard, give an example of a budget. For example, students have $20 to buy sports equiment. The cost of the equiment is:

- Basketball - $5
- Soccer ball - $4
- Football - $3
- Jump rope - $1

What items could that class get and how much would they have left over?

## Explore

### Explain:
Show students the innovation store (where the materials are kept). Starting now, students have a $10 budget (fake money) to spend on any decorations that they would like. For each item students use, they will need to subtract its price from their budget.

### Building:
Review the order that students should be working on tasks:

1. Finish building circuits on robot
2. Finish building cardboard pieces of the robot
3. Decorate the robot using innovation store budget.
