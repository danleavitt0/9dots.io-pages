## Materials:

- Computers with internet access

## Preparation:

- Create a login for codepen.io (one account can be used by all of the students)
- Gather all of the student prototypes. If you have the means, printing them out would be preferable.

##Lesson:

### REVIEW:
_Which tag surrounds the entire website?_
The **body** tag contains the rest of the HTML nested inside of it.

_What are the three parts of an HTML tag?_
The start tag, the content, and the end tag.

_What is the content of the **div** tag?_
The div can contain other HTML elements as its content.

### HOOK:
With all of the knowledge of HTML that they have gathered thus far, students now have all of the necessary tools to translate their prototypes into the HTML tags that will become their website. Today, they will label their prototype, translate it to HTML, and then input that HTML on codepen. Codepen will allow them to see their website as they create it.

### AS A GROUP:
Label the Batman Bowling worksheet. Students should have a pretty strong understanding of which label tag goes with each section. Once it is labeled students will write down the HTML on lined paper while the instructor writes on the whiteboard. 
```
<body>
	<h1> Batman Bowling </h1>
    <div>
    	<img src="batman.png">
        <p> Batman description </p>
    </div>
</body>
```
Properly formatted HTML should have nested tags indented like the example above. An element that comes before the end tag of the previous element should be indented. When they are finished make sure students have properly closed all of their tags.

### PREPARE:
Distribute the printed inkscape prototypes to the students.  If for any reason a students prototype is incomplete or missing, students should be given a piece of paper to draw their prototype. These prototypes are going to be come the websites that students create so emphasize to them the importance of having a good prototype.

### LABEL:
When students have a complete prototype, they should label each section of their page as one of the five tags that they have learned in previous lessons. It can be helpful to have a list of the tags in the room for the students to reference. Students should set up at least one div on their page and mark the body around the entire prototype.

### TRANSLATE:
On a fresh piece of paper, students will begin translating their labeled prototype into proper HTML tags. 

### ONLINE:
With their translated prototype, students will login to codepen.io and input their HTML.  Instructions for how to login and input their first pen can be found here (add link).  As they write the tags, elements will appear in the preview box (NOTE: The image names that they are currently using for the source will not display any images. Getting the source for images will be covered later.).
